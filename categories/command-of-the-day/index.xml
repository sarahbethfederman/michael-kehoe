      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of really interesting commands on Unix/ Linux systems that are either poorly documented or are plainly forgotten about. So in an effort to educate myself and others, I thought I would try and do a command of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll aim to do 5 posts a week, sometimes I’ll grep a couple of commands in to one post if they’re related.&lt;/p&gt;
