      <title>Reminders about using traceroute in multi-path networks</title>
      <link>https://michael-kehoe.io/post/reminders-about-using-traceroute-in-multi-path-networks/</link>

      <guid>https://michael-kehoe.io/post/reminders-about-using-traceroute-in-multi-path-networks/</guid>
      <description>Introduction First off, I would like to give a plug for this presentation about how to use/ interpret traceroute.
Traceroute was written before the times of MPLS, ECMP and Clos network designs. Since the rise of those technologies/ topologies, the way that engineers troubleshoot latency/ packet-loss hasn’t really evolved.
If you look at companies like Google/ Facebook/ LinkedIn, they all run Clos topologies within their production datacenters. So what does mean to engineers troubleshooting production issues?</description>

      <guid>https://michael-kehoe.io/post/command-of-the-day/</guid>
      <description>There are lots of really interesting commands on Unix/ Linux systems that are either poorly documented or are plainly forgotten about. So in an effort to educate myself and others, I thought I would try and do a command of the day.
I’ll aim to do 5 posts a week, sometimes I’ll grep a couple of commands in to one post if they’re related.</description>

      <title>Keeping a NTP server secure</title>

      <guid>https://michael-kehoe.io/post/keeping-a-ntp-server-secure/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Over the years, bad actors have used the Network Time Protocol (NTP) as a successful DDOS attack vector.
Generally speaking, the cause of these attacks is due to NTP mis-configuration.
This post will look at how to build and configure an NTP server and provide insight to help keep your NTP server safe.
Assumptions 1. You are not exposing this server to the public internet
2. You are running several NTP servers within your network to keep it highly-available.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to put this article together for some time, a complete guide to implementing iptables on a Linux Server.
Firstly, my assumptions: * You have a reasonable grasp of Linux and Iptables * You want to use Iptables to secure a Linux server
The Basics Iptables has by default three chains for the FILTER table: * INPUT * OUTPUT * FORWARD
In this case, we&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on the INPUT chain (Incoming to firewall.</description>
