Welcome to this weeks wrap.

* Facebook wrote an excellent post here about planning, scaling and load-testing their live-video services for New Years ([here](https://code.facebook.com/posts/166966743929963/how-production-engineers-support-global-events-on-facebook/?utm_source=codedot_rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS+Feed))
* A good article that cuts through the hyperbole of observability and gives a solid analysis of the space ([here](https://medium.com/@dlite/observability-the-new-wave-or-buzzword-fc23a68abf72))
* Real-time streaming ETL with Oracle Transactional data ([here](https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksql-in-action-real-time-streaming-etl-from-oracle-transactional-data))
* Building your own CDN for fun and profit ([here](https://pasztor.at/blog/building-your-own-cdn))
* Nginx now supports HTTP2 server push ([here](https://ops.tips/blog/nginx-http2-server-push/?))
* Great writeup of great Devopsy resources ([here](https://github.com/binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability))
