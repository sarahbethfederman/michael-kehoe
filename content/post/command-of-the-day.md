There are lots of really interesting commands on Unix/ Linux systems that are either poorly documented or are plainly forgotten about. So in an effort to educate myself and others, I thought I would try and do a command of the day.

I’ll aim to do 5 posts a week, sometimes I’ll grep a couple of commands in to one post if they’re related.
