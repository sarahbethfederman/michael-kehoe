Hi all,

This year marks my 3rd year at SRECon Americas. This year brings a 3-day format with the first day being exclusively dedicated to workshops. Hooray!

The workshops included:

* Containers from Scratch
* SRE Classroom, or How to Build a Distributed System in 3 Hours
* Profiling JVM Applications in Production
* Incident Command for IT - What We’ve Learned from the Fire Department
* Kubernetes 101
* Chaos Engineering Bootcamp
* Ansible for SRE Teams
* Tech Writing 101 for SREs

For the first session, I attended the `Containers from Scratch` session. As someone who understands the practical implementation of containers, I really appreciated seeing all the details behind it.

You can find the following resources from the presentation:

* [Tutorial material](https://github.com/Fewbytes/rubber-docker/)
* [Linux Primitives](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10vFQfEUvpf7qYyksNqiy-bAxcy-bvF0OnUElCOtTTRc/edit#slide=id.p)

I unfortunately didn’t get a chance to see any of Brent Chapman’s session today on Incident Management, but after going to his BayLISA presentation two weeks back, I know it would have been great. You can find his presentation materials [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CP4twU-9Mvx_feelGVDcXX6LVgAE7kwr/view)

Bridget Kromhout did a detailed `Kubernetes 101` session. From all accounts, it was awesome. You can find relevant materials here:

* [container.training GitHub](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training)

You can find James Meickle’s presentation on ‘Ansible for SRE’ [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gsAKw_BxP8MNF4HE2ZI5PKqM6m9NfHnH9omyLfcyUHg/edit)

Update (March 28th, 8am):
Tammy Butow posted her materials from her Chaos Engineering Bootcamp workshop:

* [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/tammybutow/chaos-engineering-bootcamp-srecon-2018)

Finally, I spent a little bit of time in the LinkedIn Engineering booth, thanks for everyone who stopped by and say Hi! to us.
