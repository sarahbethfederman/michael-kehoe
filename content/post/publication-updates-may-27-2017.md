Hi all,

I just updated my [publications](http://michael-kehoe.com/publications/) page with links to my SRECon17 Americas talks, my new LinkedIn engineering blog post.

It was announced this week I will also have the privilege of speaking at SRECon17 EMEA in Dublin later this year. You can find me talking about:

* Networks for SRE's: What do I need to know for troubleshooting applications
* Reducing MTTR and false escalations: Event Correlation at LinkedIn
