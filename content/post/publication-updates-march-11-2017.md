Hi all,

I just updated my [publications](http://michael-kehoe.com/publications/) page with my APRICOT presentation from earlier in the month.

If youâ€™re coming to [SRECon Americas 2017](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas) this coming week, come and check out my presentations:

* Traffic shift: Avoiding disasters at scale
* Reducing MTTR and false escalations: Event Correlation at LinkedIn
