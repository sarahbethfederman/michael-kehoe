Following on from my [Postmortem Template Document](https://michael-kehoe.io/post/postmortem-template/), I thought it would be prudent to right a similar template for Chaos Engineering Gamedays.

You can find the empty template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1hec4i4mp_buLr54Fyu0Kg3GdiUETPDYdzm52k9l03aI/edit#), I'll create a filled-out example template in the coming weeks.

Please feel free to tweet at [me](https://twitter.com/matrixtek) with any feedback
