I've been thinking about this for awhile and really wanted to publish my own Postmortem Template.

You can find the empty template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xlyAWWtpCaO-63V1Po3F2Xx4x0lrJfjBi7sD6A2ZG5s/edit?usp=sharing), I'll create a filled-out example template in the coming weeks.

Please feel free to tweet at [me](https://twitter.com/matrixtek) with any feedback
